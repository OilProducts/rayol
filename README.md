# Rayol

Experimental ray-driven voxel engine prototype. The goal is to explore ray-focused traversal and lighting against sparse voxel data.

## Status
- Fresh start; no implementation yet.
- Notes and prototypes will land here as the exploration proceeds.

## Build
- Requires a system SDL3 development package.
- Configure and build with CMake: `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build`.
